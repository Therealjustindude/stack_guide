# Environment & Setup

## One-Command Launch
- **Primary command**: `stackguide dev` or `make dev`
- **Components started**: API, UI, Chroma DB, local gpt-oss
- **Health checks**: Verify all services are running before accepting requests

## Offline-First Configuration
- **Default mode**: All features work without internet connection
- **Cloud access**: Only enabled when explicitly configured
- **Local resources**: Models, embeddings, and databases stored locally

## Development Workflow
- **Hot reloading**: API and UI changes reflect immediately
- **Configuration management**: Environment variables and config files
- **Dependency management**: Clear requirements and version specifications

## Editor Integration
- **Open file actions**: Direct links to source files from responses
- **Reveal in Explorer**: Navigate to file locations in file system
- **IDE integration**: Support for VS Code, Cursor, and other editors

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use Docker Compose for local development
- Implement health check endpoints for all services
- Provide clear error messages for configuration issues
- Support multiple environment profiles (dev, staging, prod)
