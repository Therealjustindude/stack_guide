# Architecture & Runtime Stack

## Core Technology Stack
- **LLM**: gpt-oss-20b (local via vLLM) by default, upgradeable to gpt-oss-120b for team GPU servers
- **API**: FastAPI with stateless design
- **Vector DB**: Chroma (file-backed)
- **Embeddings**: Local model (nomic-embed-text) or cloud embeddings if explicitly enabled
- **UI**: Lightweight, browser-based (React, TanStack, or Svelte)

## Design Principles
- **Stateless by design**: Persist embeddings, indexes, and settings outside the API service
- **Extensible architecture**: Pluggable connectors for various data sources
- **Local-first**: All processing happens locally unless cloud is explicitly enabled
- **Modular components**: Clear separation between ingestion, retrieval, and generation

## File Structure Guidelines
- Keep API endpoints stateless and idempotent
- Store configuration in external files, not in code
- Use dependency injection for connector plugins
- Implement proper error handling and logging
