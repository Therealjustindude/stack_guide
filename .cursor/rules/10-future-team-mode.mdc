# Future Team Mode

## Shared Infrastructure
- **Deploy shared index**: Centralized knowledge base for team access
- **GPU server deployment**: gpt-oss-120b for enhanced performance
- **Multi-tenant support**: Separate indexes for different projects/teams
- **Load balancing**: Distribute requests across multiple instances

## Role-Based Access
- **Developer role**: Full codebase access and development workflows
- **QA role**: Testing procedures and validation workflows
- **Design role**: UI/UX documentation and design systems
- **Operations role**: Deployment, monitoring, and infrastructure
- **Support role**: Customer-facing documentation and procedures

## Privacy & Security (Team Mode)
- **Same privacy rules**: Local-first principles maintained
- **Citation requirements**: All responses include source references
- **Access controls**: Role-based permissions for sensitive information
- **Audit logging**: Track all team member interactions

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use Kubernetes or Docker Swarm for orchestration
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- Provide team management dashboard
- Support multiple project indexes
- Implement team collaboration features
