# Stack Guide - Complete Rules Overview

## Project Summary
Stack Guide is a local-first, AI-powered knowledge assistant that provides instant answers about codebases, architecture, and workflows using open-source models and local vector databases.

## Rule Categories

### Core Rules (Always Applied)
- [Product North Star](mdc:.cursor/rules/00-product-north-star.mdc) - Mission, scope, and principles
- [Core Use Cases](mdc:.cursor/rules/04-core-use-cases.mdc) - Primary usage scenarios

### Technical Implementation Rules
- [Architecture & Runtime](mdc:.cursor/rules/01-architecture-runtime.mdc) - Tech stack and design principles
- [Data Ingestion & Connectors](mdc:.cursor/rules/02-data-ingestion-connectors.mdc) - Data collection and processing
- [Retrieval & Answering](mdc:.cursor/rules/03-retrieval-answering.mdc) - RAG pipeline and response generation
- [Environment & Setup](mdc:.cursor/rules/05-environment-setup.mdc) - Launch and configuration
- [Security & Privacy](mdc:.cursor/rules/06-security-privacy.mdc) - Data handling and protection
- [Observability](mdc:.cursor/rules/07-observability.mdc) - Logging, metrics, and monitoring
- [Performance & Quality](mdc:.cursor/rules/08-performance-quality.mdc) - Performance targets and quality standards
- [UX Rules](mdc:.cursor/rules/09-ux-rules.mdc) - User interface and experience guidelines
- [Future Team Mode](mdc:.cursor/rules/10-future-team-mode.mdc) - Scaling for team usage

## Key Principles
1. **Local-first**: All processing happens locally by default
2. **Privacy-focused**: No data sent to external services unless explicitly enabled
3. **Citation-required**: All answers must include source references
4. **Stateless design**: Reliable and scalable architecture
5. **Extensible**: Pluggable connectors for various data sources

## Quick Start Commands
- `stackguide dev` or `make dev` - Launch development environment
- All services start locally: API, UI, Chroma DB, gpt-oss model
