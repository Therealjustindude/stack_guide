# Security & Privacy

## Business-Ready Privacy Architecture

### Complete Data Privacy Guarantee
- **100% Local Processing**: All AI inference happens on user's machine
- **Local Vector Database**: Document embeddings never leave the computer
- **Local AI Models**: gpt-oss/llama models run entirely locally
- **No External AI Calls**: Zero data sent to external AI services by default

### Cloud Integration (User-Controlled)
- **Document Collection Only**: Pull docs from Confluence, Notion, etc.
- **Local Processing**: All documents processed and indexed locally
- **No Data Upload**: Cloud services only provide source documents
- **User Consent Required**: Cloud connectors only enabled when explicitly configured

### Business Benefits
- **Data Residency**: Everything stays in user's jurisdiction
- **Compliance Ready**: Meets strict data privacy requirements
- **No Vendor Lock-in**: Users own all their data and models
- **Offline Capable**: Works without internet once docs are pulled
- **Team Scalable**: Each user has their own secure local instance

## Local-First Architecture
- **gpt-oss runs locally**: No data sent to external LLM services by default
- **Local embeddings**: All vector embeddings stored on local machine
- **Offline processing**: Complete functionality without internet connection

## Cloud Connector Security
- **Explicit enablement**: Cloud features require user opt-in
- **Scoped tokens**: Minimal permissions for required functionality
- **Secure storage**: Encrypted storage of API keys and tokens
- **Audit logging**: Track all cloud connector usage

## Secrets & Sensitive Data Handling
- **Detection**: Automatically identify sensitive files and content
- **Redaction**: Remove secrets from both ingestion and responses
- **Reference preservation**: Point users to where secrets can be found
- **Default exclusions**: .env, .pem, .key, credentials files

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement file scanning for sensitive patterns
- Provide clear warnings about data handling
- Support user-defined exclusion patterns
- Log security events for monitoring
- Ensure all privacy features are enabled by default
- Implement clear user consent flows for cloud features
- Provide privacy status indicators in UI/CLI

- Provide clear warnings about data handling
- Support user-defined exclusion patterns
- Log security events for monitoring
