# Performance & Quality Standards

## Performance Targets
- **Response time**: P50 < 1.5s for common queries with cached retrieval
- **Throughput**: Support concurrent users without degradation
- **Resource usage**: Efficient memory and CPU utilization
- **Scalability**: Linear performance scaling with resources

## Caching Strategy
- **Embedding cache**: Store computed embeddings for reuse
- **Re-rank cache**: Cache re-ranking results for similar queries
- **Response cache**: Cache common query responses
- **Incremental updates**: Only reindex changed files

## Quality Assurance
- **Golden Q&A set**: Maintain test questions and expected answers
- **Confidence scoring**: Rate answer quality and relevance
- **User feedback**: Collect and analyze user satisfaction
- **Continuous improvement**: Regular model and prompt updates

## Implementation Guidelines
- Implement Redis or similar for caching
- Use async processing for non-blocking operations
- Monitor cache hit rates and performance metrics
- Implement A/B testing for response quality
- Regular quality audits and improvements
